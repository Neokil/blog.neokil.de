I'm Simon Schulte, a Tech Lead at Talon.One with a strong focus on backend development and system architecture. My expertise spans Golang, PostgreSQL, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Terraform, and I'm passionate about building scalable, high-performance systems.

I've been working in software development since 2016, with experience as a Senior Golang Developer and Tech Lead at different companies. 

I enjoy tackling complex technical challenges and working collaboratively to drive successful solutions.
